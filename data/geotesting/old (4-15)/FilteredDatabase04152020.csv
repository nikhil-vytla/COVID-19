The International Pharmaceutical Federation is emphasizing the active role of community and hospital pharmacists can play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 [17]. Pharmacists are often a reliable and first point of contact for individuals having concerns or needing information and advice regarding ailments. Moreover, pharmacists are readily available at community pharmacies and hospital and accessible to the general population. Essential responsibilities of pharmacists include: having appropriate medicinal products in stock; promoting proper handwashing to prevent disease; controlling in-hospital infection; and providing patient care and support. Pharmacists also play a crucial role in the prevention, early detection of certain types of new cases and referring suspected cases to the relevant healthcare authorities [17].JO - Drugs & Therapy Perspectives","Khan, Zakir; Muhammad, Khayal; Ahmed, Ali; Rahman, Hazir",,10.1007/s40267-020-00717-x,,[],,,
